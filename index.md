Welcome to the page of Generationary, a project of the [Sapienza NLP Group](http://nlp.uniroma1.it), developed with the support of the awesome [MOUSSE ERC project](http://mousse-project.org/)!

Generationary is a neural seq2seq model which contextualizes a target expression in a sentence by generating an ad hoc definition. Our work is a unified approach to computational lexical-semantic tasks, encompassing state-of-the-art Word Sense Disambiguation, Definition Modeling and Word-in-Context.

## Data and Software (Work in Progress!)
We are currently working to release software and reproduction materials. Stay tuned!
